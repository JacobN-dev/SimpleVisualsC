  tabsort() should take from user length and width of the table, and max widith of symbols in one table dot as TabW and TabL or TabH, and for the max size of table forex. TabDotMax.
  all that input should be checked by the input error handler and if given input is for example a string, give out an error etc. also the error handle should check for the type and and return the value converted from string to wanted type.
